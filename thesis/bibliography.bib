    abstract     = {We consider graphs that can be embedded on a surface of bounded genus such that each edge has a bounded number of crossings. We prove that many optimization problems, including maximumindependent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set and many others, admit polynomial time approximation schemes when restricted to such graphs. This extends previous results by Baker and Eppstein to a much broader class of graphs. We also prove that for the considered class of graphs, there are balanced separators of size {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}where n is a number of vertices in the graph. On the negative side, we prove that it is intractable to recognize the graphs embeddable in the plane with at most one crossing per edge.},

    abstract     = {A graph is 1-planar if it can be embedded in the plane with at most one crossing per edge. It is known that the problem of testing 1-planarity of a graph is NP-complete. In this paper, we study outer-1-planar graphs. A graph is outer-1-planar if it has an embedding in which every vertex is on the outer face and each edge has at most one crossing. We present a linear time algorithm to test whether a given graph is outer-1-planar. The algorithm can be used to produce an outer-1-planar embedding in linear time if it exists.},

    abstract     = {A graph is outer 1-planar (o1p) if it can be drawn in the plane such that all vertices are in the outer face and each edge is crossed at most once. o1p graphs generalize outerplanar graphs, which can be recognized in linear time, and specialize 1-planar graphs, whose recognition is {\$}{\$}{\{}NP{\}}{\$}{\$}-hard. We explore o1p graphs. Our first main result is a linear-time algorithm that takes a graph as input and returns a positive or a negative witness for o1p. If a graph~{\$}{\$}G{\$}{\$}is o1p, then the algorithm computes an embedding and can augment {\$}{\$}G{\$}{\$}to a maximal o1p graph. Otherwise, {\$}{\$}G{\$}{\$}includes one of six minors, which is detected by the recognition algorithm. Secondly, we establish structural properties of o1p graphs. o1p graphs are planar and are subgraphs of planar graphs with a Hamiltonian cycle. They are neither closed under edge contraction nor under subdivision. Several important graph parameters, such as treewidth, colorability, stack number, and queue number, increase by one from outerplanar to o1p graphs. Every o1p graph of size {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}has at most {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}5{\}}{\{}2{\}} n - 4{\$}{\$}edges and there are maximal o1p graphs with {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}11{\}}{\{}5{\}} n - {\backslash}frac{\{}18{\}}{\{}5{\}}{\$}{\$}edges, and these bounds are tight. Finally, every o1p graph has a straight-line grid drawing in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}fancyscript{\{}O{\}}(n^2){\$}{\$}area with all vertices in the outer face, a planar visibility representation in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}fancyscript{\{}O{\}}(n {\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}area, and a 3D straight-line drawing in linear volume, and these drawings can be constructed in linear time.},
