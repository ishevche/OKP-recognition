    abstract     = {A graph is outer 1-planar (o1p) if it can be drawn in the plane such that all vertices are in the outer face and each edge is crossed at most once. o1p graphs generalize outerplanar graphs, which can be recognized in linear time, and specialize 1-planar graphs, whose recognition is NP-hard. We explore o1p graphs. Our first main result is a linear-time algorithm that takes a graph as input and returns a positive or a negative witness for o1p. If a graph\&nbsp;G is o1p, then the algorithm computes an embedding and can augment G to a maximal o1p graph. Otherwise, G includes one of six minors, which is detected by the recognition algorithm. Secondly, we establish structural properties of o1p graphs. o1p graphs are planar and are subgraphs of planar graphs with a Hamiltonian cycle. They are neither closed under edge contraction nor under subdivision. Several important graph parameters, such as treewidth, colorability, stack number, and queue number, increase by one from outerplanar to o1p graphs. Every o1p graph of size n has at most 52n-4 edges and there are maximal o1p graphs with 115n-185 edges, and these bounds are tight. Finally, every o1p graph has a straight-line grid drawing in O(n2) area with all vertices in the outer face, a planar visibility representation in O(nlogn) area, and a 3D straight-line drawing in linear volume, and these drawings can be constructed in linear time.},

The layout algorithm receives as input an abstract graph, specifying connectivity relations between the elements of the diagram, and produces as output a corresponding diagram according to the aesthetics. The basic strategy is to build incrementally the layout; first, a good topology is constructed with few crossings between edges; subsequently, the shape of the diagram is determined in terms of angles appearing along edges; and finally, dimensions are given to the graph, obtaining a grid skeleton for the diagram.},

We show the surprising fact that it is NP-hard to compute the crossing number of near-planar graphs. A graph is 1-planar if it has a drawing where every edge is crossed by at most one other edge. We show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given near-planar graph is 1-planar. The main idea in both reductions is to consider the problem of simultaneously drawing two planar graphs inside a disk, with some of its vertices fixed at the boundary of the disk. This leads to the concept of anchored embedding, which is of independent interest. As an interesting consequence we obtain a new, geometric proof of NP-completeness of the crossing number problem, even when restricted to cubic graphs. This resolves a question of Hlin\v{e}n\'{y}.},
