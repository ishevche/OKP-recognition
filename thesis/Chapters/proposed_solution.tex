\section{ILP Formulation}\label{subsec:ILP-def}

The result of the integral linear program should be an arrangement of vertices on a line.
Given the arrangement of the vertices, we can definitively identify whether two edges cross each other.
Indeed, consider two edges, $uv$ and $st$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $u$ is located before $v$ in the arrangement, $s$ before $t$, and $u$ before $s$.
Under these assumptions, the edges $uv$ and $st$ cross if and only if $s$ is located before $v$ and $t$ after $v$.

The arrangement is represented using the so-called ``ordering variables''.
For every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, we create a binary variable $a_{u, v}$ that defines the order in which they appear in the arrangement.
$a_{u, v} = 1$ indicates that $u$ is located before $v$ and vice versa, and $a_{u, v} = 0$ indicates that $v$ is located before $u$ or $u$ and $v$ is the same vertex.

For these variables, it is crucial to ensure transitivity.
That is, if $a_{u, v} = 1$ and $a_{v, w} = 1$ which means $u$ is located before $v$ and $v$ is located before $w$, then $u$ must be located before $w$, so the following should hold $a_{u, w} = 1$.
This can be ensured by the following constraint: $a_{u, w} \geqslant a_{u, v} + a_{v, w} - 1$.
This constraint will restrict the value of $a_{u, w}$ if and only if both $a_{u, v}$ and $a_{v, w}$ equal $1$.
Otherwise, the constraint will have no impact on the system at all.

Having the arrangement of the vertices, we can now deduce for each pair of edges $uv$ and $st$ whether they intersect or not.
Naturally, there are 24 different arrangements of the vertices, as demonstrated in figure~\ref{fig:edge_crossings}.
Among them, there are only eight in which the edges intersect.
Thus, the edge $uv$ crosses the edge $st$ if and only if one of the following holds:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $a_{u,s} = 1$, $a_{s,v} = 1$, and $a_{v,t} = 1$
    \item $a_{u,t} = 1$, $a_{t,v} = 1$, and $a_{v,s} = 1$
    \item $a_{v,s} = 1$, $a_{s,u} = 1$, and $a_{u,t} = 1$
    \item $a_{v,t} = 1$, $a_{t,u} = 1$, and $a_{u,s} = 1$
    \item $a_{s,u} = 1$, $a_{u,t} = 1$, and $a_{t,v} = 1$
    \item $a_{t,u} = 1$, $a_{u,s} = 1$, and $a_{s,v} = 1$
    \item $a_{s,v} = 1$, $a_{v,t} = 1$, and $a_{t,u} = 1$
    \item $a_{t,v} = 1$, $a_{v,s} = 1$, and $a_{s,u} = 1$
\end{itemize}

To describe this in the linear program, we create a binary variable $c_{uv, st}$ for every pair of edges $uv$ and $st$.
$c_{uv, st} = 0$ indicates that the edge $uv$ does not cross $st$.
To ensure the correctness of these values, we impose eight constraints on each variable, one for each case from above.
For example, considering the case $a_{u,s} = 1$, $a_{s,v} = 1$, and $a_{v,t} = 1$, we impose the following restriction: $c_{uv, st} \geqslant a_{u,s} + a_{s,v} + a_{v,t} - 2$, which ensures that $c_{uv, st}$ equals $1$ whenever the vertices are ordered as $usvt$.
Making this for each case restricts $c_{uv, st}$ to the value $1$ if the vertices are arranged in one of the eight ``intersecting'' configurations, ensuring that $c_{uv, st} = 0$ is possible only if $uv$ does not cross $st$.

The algorithm's objective is to minimize the maximal number of crossings per edge.
This value can be written as follows: $\max_{uv \in E(G)} \sum_{st \in E(G)} c_{uv, st}$.
Unfortunately, it cannot represent an objective function for a linear program as the $\max$ operation is not linear.
To solve this, we introduce a new integer variable $k$.
To ensure that it is equal to the objective value, we impose the following constraint on $k$: $k \geqslant \sum_{st \in E(G)} c_{uv, st}$ for each edge $uv \in E(G)$.

So, the integer linear program can be described as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \textbf{minimize}\quad&k\\
    \textbf{subject to}\quad&&k &\geqslant \sum_{st \in E(G)} c_{uv, st},&&\forall uv \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{u,s} + a_{s,v} + a_{v,t} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{u,t} + a_{t,v} + a_{v,s} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{v,s} + a_{s,u} + a_{u,t} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{v,t} + a_{t,u} + a_{u,s} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{s,u} + a_{u,t} + a_{t,v} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{t,u} + a_{u,s} + a_{s,v} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{s,v} + a_{v,t} + a_{t,u} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\geqslant a_{t,v} + a_{v,s} + a_{s,u} - 2,&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&a_{u, w} &\geqslant a_{u, v} + a_{v, w} - 1,&&\forall u, v, w \in V(G)\\
    &&c_{uv, st} &\in \{0, 1\},&&\forall uv, st \in E(G)\\
    &&a_{u, v} &\in \{0, 1\},&&\forall u, v \in V(G)\\
\end{align*}

\section{SAT Formulation}

Another approach to solving this problem is to check for a specific $k$ whether the given graph is outer-$k$-planar.
This check can be encoded as a boolean satisfiability problem.
This problem asks whether it is possible to assign logic values $\textsc{True}$ or $\textsc{False}$ so that all disjunctive clauses are satisfied.
A disjunctive clause is a single literal or a disjunction of several.
Literal is either a variable or a negation of a variable, with the former being the positive and the latter the negative literal.


Similarly to the ILP algorithm described in~\ref{subsec:ILP-def}, this algorithm uses the same ``ordering variables'' $a_{u, v}$ for each pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ that represent the arrangement of the vertices.
If the boolean variable $a_{u, v}$ is $\textsc{True}$, the vertex $u$ is located before the vertex $v$ and vice versa otherwise.

Similarly, these variables must account for transitivity, which means that for every triple of vertices $u$, $v$, and $w$ $a_{u, v} \equiv \textsc{True}$ and $a_{v, w} \equiv \textsc{True}$ implies $a_{u, w} \equiv \textsc{True}$.
This can be written as follows: $a_{u, v} \land a_{v, w} \rightarrow a_{u, w}$.
Expanding the implication, this transforms into $\overline{a_{u, v} \land a_{v, w}} \lor a_{u, w}$.
After applying De Morgan's law, we receive $\overline{a_{u, v}} \lor \overline{a_{v, w}} \lor a_{u, w}$, which represents a clause in the SAT problem.

The next step is to represent the crossing variables $c_{uv, st}$ in terms of the ordering ones for each pair of edges $uv$ and $st$.
Similarly to the ILP algorithm, we can restrict $c_{uv, st}$ to $\textsc{True}$ if $uv$ and $st$ cross by adding new clauses to the problem.
The clauses are constructed by making the implications for each of the eight intersecting cases shown in figure~\ref{fig:edge_crossings}, expanding them, and applying De Morgan's law.
For example, for the case $a_{u,s} = 1$, $a_{s,v} = 1$, and $a_{v,t} = 1$, we start with the logical equation as follows: $a_{u,s} \land a_{s,v} \land a_{v,t} \rightarrow c_{uv, st}$.
Afterwards, we expand the implication: $\overline{a_{u,s} \land a_{s,v} \land a_{v,t}} \lor c_{uv, st}$.
Finally, we apply De Morgan's law: $\overline{a_{u,s}} \lor \overline{a_{s,v}} \lor \overline{a_{v,t}} \lor c_{uv, st}$ receiving one of the eight clauses for $c_{uv, st}$.

% Help
The last step in the construction of the problem is to count the number of crossings for each edge.
The goal of this solver is to check whether the number of crossings can be smaller or equal to some constant $k$ for each edge.
To ensure this, we can build a set of clauses that prevent the problem from being satisfiable if the value $k$ is too small.
To do so, for every edge $e_0$, we consider all combinations of $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{k+1}$ for each of which we construct the following clause: $\overline{c_{e_0, e_1}} \lor \overline{c_{e_0, e_2}} \lor \cdots\lor \overline{c_{e_0, e_{k+1}}}$.
Doing so, we ensure that for each edge $e_0$, no $k + 1$ different edges intersect $e_0$, which effectively means that each edge has at most $k$ crossings if all clauses are satisfied.
